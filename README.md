# SAChant
Plugin wordpress to plan the Allez'Chant week.

## Inside:

- Form to select activities and other costs (e.g. meals)
- Schedule display with FullCalendar updating w.r.t the selected activities
- Price total and details w.r.t selected activities
- PDF generation of the price details for download


## To install and use the plugin
Download the code as a zip, and import the .zip file with the wordpress "upload plugin" button.

Then, include the `[edt]` shortcode into the desired wordpress page.

## Notes
Getting the calendar display into a pdf is horribly buggy and a known issue with FullCalendar.
Thus, the PDF only has price breakdown.
